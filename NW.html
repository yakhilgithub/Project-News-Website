                    <h2>Dating trends 2023: From ghosting to stonewalling, toxic patterns that made news in 2023 :</h2>
                    <p>Dating trends 2023: Be it gaslighting or blame game, here are a few toxic trends we should be aware of in a relationship.
                        Dating in modern times is a lot different than how it used to be earlier. While the options are rampant, sticking by someone and having an old school romance is still the most beautiful thing to do. With social media, dating apps and other mediums, it is easier to connect with more people and screen and find the one who matches our vibe. However, things can also get toxic in very less time, and while we may have a difficult time figuring out what is healthy for us, we should keep a watch on the relationship patterns, toxic trends and behavioural patterns that can affect us mentally, emotionally and even physically.</p>
