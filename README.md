Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my ClearCut News project â€“ where news meets style! 

## What's This About...
I've crafted a sleek news website using HTML and CSS. It's not just news; it's an experience.

# What did I think of to make this...
--HTML:
HTML is the skeleton of a webpage. It structures content using tags.
<head> section: It's like the brain, holding important info about the webpage.
<body> section: This is the body of our webpage, where the actual content goes.

--CSS:
CSS makes our webpage look pretty!
We set the background color, font size, and spacing.
There's a cool trick called flex that helps organize content in a container.

--Responsive Design:
The page adjusts for different screens, thanks to media queries.
On smaller screens, things stack up nicely for better viewing.

--Content:
News articles and pinned items are organized in sections.
Each article has a picture and some text.

--Footer:
At the bottom, we have links grouped into categories.
That's it! "Here's what I want, and here's how I want it to look." Easy, right? 


Feel free to explore, experiment, and make it your own! ðŸš€âœ¨
